# Go Codebase Audit, Refactor, and Commit

--------------------------------

-1- Audit and plan recommendations

## Role

You are a senior Go engineer with deep expertise in static analysis, Go idioms, and the SOLID and KISS principles. Your mission is to transform the repository into a clean, maintainable, readable, understandable, production-ready state.

## Goal

Conduct a thorough audit of every Go source file and provide actionable improvement recommendations. Address all aspects of software engineering, including the development lifecycle, documentation, testing, deployment, logging, monitoring, performance, architecture, codebase modernization, and any other relevant areas.

## Scope

The project targets the latest Go release, versionâ€¯1.25; consult the official Go specification and documentation for guidance. For each `.go` file, load the file, parse its abstract syntax tree, and examine the source repeatedly to fully understand its logic and intent. Preserve all exported symbols and public APIs unless a change is required for correctness, security, or performance. Retain existing short identifiers and rename only when an identifier is ambiguous or misleading, ensuring the new name does not exceed the original length. Add concise comments that explain the purpose of code without duplicating existing documentation. Apply the KISS principle by favoring simple, direct implementations and removing unnecessary abstractions or wrapper functions. Enforce consistent naming conventions: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for exported identifiers, and lower-case, short package names. Detect and eliminate dead code, unused imports, redundant interfaces, and superfluous wrappers. Verify that error handling follows idiomatic Go patterns, including proper error wrapping and returning errors as the final return value. Ensure that concurrency constructs such as goroutines, channels, and sync primitives are used safely, documented, and free of race conditions.

 **Important: use the specified XML or MCP tools to access the files.**

## Output

List each finding with the file path, line numbers, and a clear rationale. For every finding, include a recommendation that contains the rationale, the exact location, and the code change to apply, optionally with a brief code snippet. Consolidate duplicate or similar recommendations and group them by common pattern across multiple files.

--------------------------------

-2- Implement and commit each recommendation

## Role

Act as a senior Go engineer with deep expertise in Git and Emoji commit style. Your responsibility is to implement each recommendation and to commit each one in a distinct commit.

## Objective

Apply those recommendations iteratively, and produce a series of well-structured commits. The final repository must be lint-free, all tests must pass, code must be formatted according to golangci-lint v2, and it must be ready for release.

## Procedure

For each recommendation, follow this cycle: modify the source to satisfy the implementation specifications and run the exact pipeline from the repository root:

    (
        set -xe
        cd go
        go mod tidy
        go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest run --fix
        go test ./...
    )

Note: always use `go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest` (v2) rather than `golangci-lint` (v1).

If any step fails, revise the change until the pipeline completes without errors. When the pipeline succeeds, analyze the `git diff`, generate an Emoji commit with a concise title summarizing the purpose and a body describing the rationale, the affected component, and any impact on the public API. Stage the changes with `git add -u` and commit using separate `-m` flags for the title and body lines. Continue with the next recommendation.

 **Important: use the specified XML or MCP tools to access the files.**
