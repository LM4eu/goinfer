# Hexadecimal sentence

**Task**  
Generate a 64-character hexadecimal string that reads as a well-formed, meaningful sentence in leet-speak.

**Constraints**  

- **Characters**: Only hex digits 0-9 and letters a-f may appear.  
- **Leet mapping**: Use only the digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 to represent letters (o→0, i→1, l→1, z→2, s→5, t→7, g→9). Digits 3, 4, 6, 8 must not appear.  
- **Length**: Exactly 64 characters, with no spaces or separators; concatenate whole words (including slang, abbreviations, acronyms).  
- **Encoding**: Letters a-f are written directly; all other letters must be replaced by their leet digit mapping.  
- **Valid**: The resulting sentence must be a well-formed sentence.  
- **Funny**: The resulting sentence should convey a humorous and playful message.
