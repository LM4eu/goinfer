# Improve prompt

## Original

You are an AI prompt writer. Generate an enhanced version of this markdown prompt intended to an AI assistant (reply with only the enhanced prompt - no conversation, explanations, lead-in, bullet points, placeholders, or surrounding quotes):

## Reduce the size

You are a prompt engineer. Read the markdown prompt provided below thoroughly and repeatedly until you fully understand it. Then rewrite the prompt to be clearer, more concise, and optimized for an AI assistant. Return only the revised prompt, without any explanations, introductions, bullet points, placeholders, or surrounding quotation marks.

## Keep similar size

You are a prompt engineer. Read the markdown prompt provided below thoroughly and repeatedly until you fully understand it. Then rewrite the prompt to be clearer and optimized for an AI assistant. Return only the revised prompt, without any explanations, introductions, bullet points, placeholders, or surrounding quotation marks.

## Full rewrite + concise

As a prompt engineer, read the markdown prompt below repeatedly until you fully understand it. Then rewrite it to improve relevance, clarity, readability, and conciseness for an AI assistant. Output only the revised prompt without any explanations, introductions, bullet points, placeholders, or surrounding quotation marks.

## Full rewrite + same size

As a prompt engineer, read the markdown prompt below repeatedly until you fully understand it. Then rewrite it to improve relevance, clarity, and readability for an AI assistant. Output only the revised prompt without any explanations, introductions, bullet points, placeholders, or surrounding quotation marks.

## Refactor / reorganize / update / rearrange

You are a prompt engineer. Your objective is generate a better version of the following prompt intended to AI assistant. Read the following prompt repeatedly until you fully understand its intent, purpose, and rationale. Correct any spelling errors. If any part remains ambiguous, explain with comprehensive details and request the user clarification. Then elaborate a new prompt: reorganize sections, update titles, reorder/rephrase sentences and paragraphs for logical flow, using clearer, more precise language. Produce a more relevant, clear, and understandable version that preserves the original intent, purpose, and rationale while optimizing it for an AI assistant. Return only the new prompt without any explanations, introductions, bullet points, placeholders, or surrounding quotation marks.

## v7

You are a prompt engineer tasked with improving a given prompt for an AI assistant. First, read the original prompt repeatedly until you fully comprehend its intent, purpose, and rationale. Correct any spelling or grammatical errors you encounter. If any portion remains unclear, provide a detailed description of the ambiguity and request clarification from the user. Next, generate a new prompt: reorganize its sections, update titles, and reorder or rephrase sentences and paragraphs to achieve a logical flow and clearer, more precise language. Ensure the enhanced version retains the original intent, purpose, and rationale while being optimized for an AI assistant. Finally, output only the enhanced prompt—no explanations, introductions, bullet points, placeholders, or quotation marks.

## v8

You are a prompt engineer.

The portion of this message that follows the line containing exactly three hyphens (---) is named the ‘provided prompt’.

Read the ‘provided prompt’ carefully, and, if necessary, read it repeatedly to fully understand its intent, purpose, and rationale.

Correct any spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors within the ‘provided prompt’. The result is named the ‘corrected draft’.

If any part of the ‘corrected draft’ still lacks clear meaning, print within a code-bock that ‘corrected draft’ with the ambiguous segment enclosed in double-angle brackets. Then add a section that describes each ambiguity in detail and suggests at least two alternative phrasings to resolve each ambiguity, and stop.

Using the ‘corrected draft’, create a new refactored prompt that an AI assistant can understand and execute, applying the following guidelines:

- For each existing bullet-point block, reorder, arrange, split, or combine the bullet points to improve clarity.
- Create sections whenever a new idea, step, or argument begins, ensuring each section has a clear purpose.
- Reorder whole paragraphs for logical flow and rephrase any unclear sentences.
- Combine short, related sentences into a single sentence when this improves brevity without sacrificing meaning.
- Add headings where the text lacks clear sections, or refine existing headings to improve clarity.
- Arrange the sections so that each leads logically to the next, ensuring smooth, logical progression without sudden topic shifts.
- Rearrange sentences where needed and rephrase paragraphs to improve clarity.
- Divide the text into sections based on distinct topics or themes.
- Reorder the sections to follow a natural progression (e.g., from background to conclusion).
- Merge overlapping sections to eliminate redundancy.

Perform a cyclical process consisting of reviewing, identifying, analyzing, and rewriting the prompt: a thorough, line-by-line review of the latest version of the prompt you have produced within the current iteration of this cyclical process, identifying any ambiguities, and resolving each ambiguity by applying a structured, step-by-step methodology (e.g., identify → analyze → rewrite).

Repeat this cyclical process until no ambiguities remain, preserving the intent, purpose, and rationale of the ‘provided prompt’, and balancing brevity with completeness while minimizing token count and preserving full clarity for AI execution.

Output the ‘provided prompt’, followed by a line containing three hyphens (---) and your final revised prompt.

## v9.0

**Definitions**

- **Provided Prompt**: The text that follows the line containing exactly three hyphens (---) in this message.
- **Corrected Draft**: The provided prompt after all spelling, punctuation, and grammar errors have been fixed.
- **Final Revised Prompt**: The fully refactored version of the corrected draft, ready for AI execution.

**Step 1 – Proofread**

1. Read the provided prompt carefully, re-reading if necessary to grasp its intent, purpose, and rationale.
2. Correct any spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors.
3. Save the result as the *corrected draft*.

**Step 2 – Ambiguity Check**

- If any portion of the corrected draft remains unclear:
  1. Output the corrected draft inside a code block, enclosing each ambiguous segment in double-angle brackets (<<…>>).
  2. Immediately follow with a section that:
     - Describes each ambiguity in detail.
     - Offers at least two alternative phrasings to resolve it.
  3. **Stop** after this output.

**Step 3 – Refactor (when no ambiguities remain)**
Using the corrected draft, rewrite the prompt so an AI assistant can understand and execute it. Apply all of the following guidelines:

- Reorder, split, combine, or otherwise arrange bullet-point blocks for clarity.
- Introduce sections with headings whenever a new idea, step, or argument begins; ensure each section has a clear purpose.
- Reorder whole paragraphs for logical flow; rephrase any unclear sentences.
- Merge short, related sentences into a single concise sentence where possible.
- Add missing headings or refine existing ones for better navigation.
- Ensure each section leads naturally to the next, avoiding abrupt topic shifts.
- Rearrange sentences as needed and rephrase paragraphs for maximum clarity.
- Divide the text into thematic sections.
- Order sections in a natural progression (e.g., background → method → conclusion).
- Eliminate redundancy by merging overlapping sections.

**Cyclical Review Process**

- Conduct a line-by-line review of the latest version.
- Identify any remaining ambiguities.
- Analyze each ambiguity, then rewrite to resolve it.
- Repeat until no ambiguities remain, preserving the original intent while minimizing token count.

**Final Output**

1. Print the original *provided prompt* exactly as received.
2. Print a line containing three hyphens (---).
3. Print the *final revised prompt* you have produced.
