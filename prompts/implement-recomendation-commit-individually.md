# Comprehensive Multi‑Pass Audit of Go Package @/infer  

## Objective  

Audit every Go source file (`*.go`) in the directory `/home/c/j3/goinfer/infer`. No external Go tooling may be invoked; analysis must be performed by reading the source code directly.

## Audit Passes  

- **Functional Correctness** – verify logical correctness of code paths, proper error handling, and expected API behavior.  
- **Performance Bottlenecks** – locate inefficient algorithms, unnecessary allocations, blocking calls, or any construct that may cause latency or high CPU/memory usage.  
- **Security Vulnerabilities** – identify insecure patterns such as unchecked inputs, insecure defaults, hard‑coded secrets, misuse of `exec`, etc.  
- **Maintainability Concerns** – detect duplicated code, oversized functions, confusing naming, overly complex logic, or missing documentation/comments.  
- **Go Idioms Adherence** – ensure idiomatic Go usage (error handling style, use of `context`, naming conventions, proper slice/map handling, concurrency patterns, etc.).  
- **Architectural Soundness** – assess package boundaries, cohesion, coupling, layering, and overall design for scalability and extensibility.  
- **Tests** – add and complete any missing test coverage.  
- **Documentation** – add and complete any missing package, type, and function documentation.  

## Constraints  

- Follow the KISS principle throughout: keep code simple, direct, and easy to read.  
- Perform an initial scan that flags complex constructs or layered abstractions without altering existing short identifiers.  
- For each flagged complexity, rewrite using the simplest possible construct while preserving original short identifiers; rename only when ambiguity forces it, using an equally short, clear abbreviation.  
- Consolidate naming: keep identifiers concise; introduce new short names only when a symbol is ambiguous, and ensure the new name is no longer than the original.  
- Streamline documentation: add brief comments that explain intent without duplicating existing explanations.  
- Conduct a final verification pass to confirm no unnecessary abstraction layers remain and that naming constraints are satisfied across the codebase.  
- Do **not** invoke any external Go tooling (`go fmt`, `go vet`, `staticcheck`, linters, etc.) for analysis.  
- Preserve all existing public APIs unless a modification is mandatory for correctness or security.  
- Do **not** introduce new public symbols unless required to fix a bug or mitigate a security issue.  
- All suggested changes must be minimal and straightforward.  

## Deduplication & Recommendations  

Eliminate duplicate findings and condense the remaining items into actionable improvement recommendations.  

## Implementation Cycle  

For each recommendation, follow these steps:  

1. Apply the change.  

2. Execute the following commands:  

   ```bash
   go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest run --fix && go test ./...
   ```  

3. If lint errors or test failures appear, fix them and repeat step 2 until the run succeeds without issues.  

4. When the codebase passes linting and testing, review the modifications to determine their intent, purpose, and rationale.  

5. Write a conventional commit message consisting of:  
   - A concise title that captures the intent, purpose, and recommendation.  
   - A blank line.  
   - A detailed body describing the rationale and the specific changes made.  

6. Commit the changes using:  

   ```bash
   git commit --file -
   ```  

7. Proceed to the next recommendation.  

Repeat this cycle until all recommendations have been processed and the codebase passes linting and testing with no errors.
