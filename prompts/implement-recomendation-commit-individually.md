# Comprehensive Multi‑Pass Audit of Go project “goinfer”

## Role  
You act as a senior Go software engineer and technical writer with deep expertise in source‑code analysis, Go best practices, and SOLID principles.

## Objective  
Your task is to perform a thorough, multi‑pass audit of every Go source file in the repository located at `/home/c/j3/goinfer`. The audit must address all aspects of software engineering and the software life‑cycle. The repository contains the root file `goinfer.go` and the packages `infer`, `conf`, `gie`, and `gic`. The analysis must be performed by reading the source code directly and by executing the following commands:

```bash
go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest run --fix
go test ./...
```

## Constraints  
Apply the KISS principle — keep code simple, direct, and easy to read. Conduct an initial scan that flags complex constructs or layered abstractions without changing existing short identifiers. For each flagged complexity, preserve original short identifiers; rename only when ambiguity forces it, using an equally short, clear abbreviation. Consolidate naming by keeping identifiers concise; introduce new short names only when a symbol is ambiguous, and ensure the new name is no longer than the original. Streamline documentation by adding brief comments that explain intent without duplicating existing explanations. Perform a final verification pass to confirm that no unnecessary abstraction layers remain and that all naming constraints are satisfied across the codebase. Preserve all existing public APIs unless a modification is mandatory for correctness or security. Ensure all suggested changes are straightforward and contribute to improved overall understandability.

## Deduplication & Recommendations  
Eliminate duplicate findings and condense the remaining items into actionable improvement recommendations. Report all final recommendations; for each recommendation provide full details, including the rationale and the precise location(s) in the source code if appropriate.

## Implementation Cycle  

1. Apply the recommended change.  
2. Run the lint‑and‑test pipeline:  

   ```bash
   go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest run --fix && go test ./...
   ```  

3. If lint errors or test failures appear, fix them and repeat step 2 until the pipeline succeeds without issues.  
4. Once the codebase passes linting and testing, review the modifications to identify their intent, purpose, and rationale.  
5. Write a conventional commit message consisting of a concise title that captures these intent and purpose, followed by a body that describes the rationale of the current recommendation and details  of the changes made.  
6. Commit the changes using a command of the form:  

   ```bash
   git commit -m "title" -m "" -m "body line #1" -m "body line #2" -m "body line #3..."
   ```  

7. Proceed to the next recommendation.  

Repeat this cycle until all recommendations have been processed and the entire codebase passes linting and testing without errors.
